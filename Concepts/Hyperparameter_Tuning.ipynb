    "# Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "1) It is technique that facilitates drawing the best estimators out of a combination of different estimators put together.<br>\n",
    "2) It is used to tune model parameters to get better results(better accuracy, better R2Score) from the model.<br>\n",
    "3) It can be implemented using the following two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) GridSearchCV\n",
    "1) It takes into account all the permutations and combinations of the parameters and then returns the set of parameters that best optimizes the result.<br>\n",
    "2) It takes a lot of time\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) RandomizedSearchCV\n",
    "1) It takes into consideration few randomly selected combinations of parameters and then returns the set of parameters that best optimizes the result.<br>\n",
    "2) It is comparitively faster than GridSearchCV"
