# ML Projects

This repository contains various small machine learning projects that I have created to demonstrate my understanding of the basics of machine learning. The projects are:

- Diabetic Patients Classification:
This project uses machine learning to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their medical features.
- Gender Prediction based on Voice:
This project uses machine learning to predict the gender of a person based on their voice.
- House Price Prediction:
This project uses machine learning to predict the price of a house based on its features.
- Breast Cancer Prediction:
This project demonstrates how to tune the hyperparameters of a machine learning model to improve its performance to predict breast cancer.
- Income Prediction Project:
This project predicts the income of an individual based on their education, work experience, and other factors.
- Petrol Consumption Prediction:
This project predicts the petrol consumption of a car based on its features.
- Titanic Survivor Prediction:
This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on their features.
- Wine Quality Classification:
This project classifies wine into different quality categories based on its features.

I hope you find these projects interesting and informative!
